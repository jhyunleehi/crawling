We have two 1-year-old kitties who are very rambunctious to say the least. They have not been able to break this toy and I immediately purchased a second one. They stayed entertained by it for at least an hour and it held its charge even longer than that. Our 12-year-old kitty enjoys it as well. The tails do pick up fur, but it's easily wiped off with a damp cloth. It's also important to clean around the base where the tail connects, as hair and fur get wrapped around it. And I appreciate the heads-up from PetCronies concerning a problem with tails coming off, but I haven't experienced that problem at all. Excellent customer service and high-quality product--such a nice change in today's world. I will continue to order from them and hope that they make even more products in the near future."
3,2023-04-13,4,,Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ,"My Cat's Favorite Toy, By Far","My cat LOVES this toy.  When she first comes out to the family room in the morning, she is asking for it...and that continues through the day.  She has a history of loving a toy for a day or two and then getting bored...but this one is still a favorite after more than a week!  So, even if she gets bored at some point into will go into the toy rotation to be periodically brought back out.  In fact, she loves it so much I had to get a second one...which leads to the one of the few negatives.  The charge on the toy only lasts for a few 10 minute sessions.  The other negative is the easy chew of the silicone tail.  Since it is sooo easy to chew into pieces, I appreciate the baby food grade quality of the silicone.  However, with a hunter they like to chew when they have captured their prey...which means my girl has already chewed one tail down to nubbins and is working on the second.  Fortunately, she doesn't seem to be swallowing the small bits she chews, but I now keep an eye on her while she plays once I realized how easily she could get a chunk off the tail.  Even with those negatives...it is a good toy and I have a very happy cat."

However, you can tell she loves the toy as she was trying to get it even as I was trying to take a photo and put it away! So I'm just here to second all the other reviews that tell you that the silicone tail is not for chewers... I didn't know this when I purchased but they do sell the toy with the furry cloth tail included instead of the default silicone tail. I don't have the cloth tail so I don't know if it is as addicting for the cat as the silicone tail is (which whips around pretty wildly), nor do I know how durable it is, but maybe worth a shot!"
5,2023-05-25,5,,Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ,My Cat will play with it even when it's off,"This is one of my cat's favorite toys! He is one out of four cats that we have and he typically watches the other play. As soon as I turned this toy at any time of the day, he will come running to play with it. He will even play with it when it is off and occasionally turn it on himself. I wish the toy had a motion detector and would turn on automatically, but he thinks it's fun either way. We have to hid it to charge it. He has chewed through the tail, but I am not concerned about him eating it."
6,2023-05-24,4,,Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ,Loud,"We have two cats who like to watch this toy move. The thing is, the tail is a hard rubber and moves so fast that itâ€™s like a whip. Since it moves so fast and doesnâ€™t have a rubber coating on the bottom, it is LOUD when it travels to out stone flooring. Worth the price if you have carpet."
7,2023-05-27,4,,Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ,My cats LOVE it,"This toy is awesome, my cats play with it a lot. They would play with it a lot more if the battery lasted more then an hour. It takes 6 hours to charge it fully."
8,2023-02-11,4,,Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ,"Kitty loves it, but battery life could be better","I was pretty skeptical of this toy. I genuinely didn't expect my cat to want to play with it on its own automatic movement setting. I bought it because I was going to just play with the dangly ""tail"" parts. She loves things of that texture! It's kind of rubbery and it flips around like crazy when you jiggle it."
9,0001-01-01,4,,Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ,Wish it had a slow speed,"Both of my two-year-old cats are very intrigued by this, but it's much too fast and sometimes scares them away. They generally just sit and watch it from a distance. It does travel across the floor due to the shape and often gets wedged between furniture, but still wiggles like crazy and gives the cats something to watch. I lock it away after each play session so they can't chew up the tail, so that hasn't been a problem. It definitely needs to have a slower setting though, much too fast."
10,2023-04-27,4,,Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ,Perfect for cats who like chaos,"It needs a speed function. Spins way too fast, it looks like the tentacles of a demigorgen or slenderman.
