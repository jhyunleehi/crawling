Bought the 65"" Q80T to upgrade my 60"" UN60ES7500F bought in 2012 in my family room.  The ES7500F still works great so I moved it to my bedroom.  The Q80T is a beautiful TV, similar in most respects to the ES7500F from 8 years ago.  I upgraded the HDMI cables to 8K cables, and upgraded my Xfinity box to 4K.  The picture is very nice, I would say marginally better than the 7500F.  I expected a more significant improvement.  I even watched several 4K movies and the picture quality was very good. For 4K movies, the black bars appear at the top and bottom of the screen even though I have the options set to full screen on the TV and cable box, very annoying and pretty much defeats having a 4K TV.  In my opinion, I don't want a 65"" TV that is reduced considerably in size by the black bars.  This is not unique to Samsung, but with the option selected it should fill the entire TV screen.

The Q80T is a beautiful TV, similar in most respects to the ES7500F from 8 years ago.  I upgraded the HDMI cables to 8K cables, and upgraded my Xfinity box to 4K.  The picture is very nice, I would say marginally better than the 7500F.  I expected a more significant improvement.  I even watched several 4K movies and the picture quality was very good. For 4K movies, the black bars appear at the top and bottom of the screen even though I have the options set to full screen on the TV and cable box, very annoying and pretty much defeats having a 4K TV.  In my opinion, I don't want a 65"" TV that is reduced considerably in size by the black bars.  This is not unique to Samsung, but with the option selected it should fill the entire TV screen.  So far, I do not see a big improvement with 4K.  Its really nice, but not so much better than my previous 1080 LED TV."
