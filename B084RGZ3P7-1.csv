Bought the 65"" Q80T to upgrade my 60"" UN60ES7500F bought in 2012 in my family room.  The ES7500F still works great so I moved it to my bedroom.  The Q80T is a beautiful TV, similar in most respects to the ES7500F from 8 years ago.  I upgraded the HDMI cables to 8K cables, and upgraded my Xfinity box to 4K.  The picture is very nice, I would say marginally better than the 7500F.  I expected a more significant improvement.  I even watched several 4K movies and the picture quality was very good. For 4K movies, the black bars appear at the top and bottom of the screen even though I have the options set to full screen on the TV and cable box, very annoying and pretty much defeats having a 4K TV.  In my opinion, I don't want a 65"" TV that is reduced considerably in size by the black bars.  This is not unique to Samsung, but with the option selected it should fill the entire TV screen.  So far, I do not see a big improvement with 4K.  Its really nice, but not so much better than my previous 1080 LED TV."

This 50inch was the same dimensional size, but without the plastic borders, so the screen is technically larger within the same size."
55,2020-07-28,5,,Reviewed in the United States ,Met expectations and more...,"The last TV I bought was a very good TV and I had yet to see anything that made me want a new TV.  It was also a samsung but was a 2015 model.  I received a great many compliments on that TV from guests who visited us.  As a result, i was very skeptical when I started exploring other TV options.  (the old TV still works fine but we are expanding so why not a new TV right??  lol)"
56,0001-01-01,4,,Reviewed in the United States ,"Great TV, but not without a few hiccups","I bought the 65 inch version of this TV primarily to play console video games and occasionally watch movies. I have owned it for a week, and have used the Disney + app, Youtube app, Samsung tv plus, and have connected my Wii U, Nintendo Switch, PS3, & regular PS4 to it. I watched a Mission Impossible blu ray on the PS4. Here are my thoughts:"
57,2021-06-21,3,,Reviewed in the United States ,"Samsung seems to have a reputation for a great picture, but...","Samsung is suppose to have a great picture, but frankly I have not found it to be anything exceptional.  Perhaps this is due to the limiting factor of picture quality, that is, the source.  My main sources are over-the-air reception and the internet via a dedicated computer.  OTA is allegedly digital, though most of the time it does not look like it; and much of the internet is suppose to be high res, though increasing one's feed to the maximum resolution affects downloads, so I usually go 720 ppi max."
58,2020-08-21,4,,Reviewed in the United States ,Love it,"Arrived a day ahead of expected time, packed securely, box and TV in perfect condition. This is our 2nd QLED, and our 6th Samsung, at home in various rooms, and we have 2 in business office. Very happy with all of them. I do like the smart button OneRemote that Samsung uses. Less is more, as far as buttons are concerned. I HATE remotes with more than about 10 buttons. My preferences for remotes follows the early Apple TV silver remote, before they went to the current glass and touch pad. Samsung has it right on the OneRemote. I will note that as you drop down the Samsung model family, the software on them isn't as robust to recognize other devices, but the Q80T is just fine."

60,2020-11-14,5,,Reviewed in the United States ,Don't believe every review!,Take every review with a grain of salt that only a small percentage of people actually take the time to write reviews and so you usually get the extremes be it both good and bad.
61,0001-01-01,5,,Reviewed in the United States ,Totally awesome!  More fun than I expected from a TV!!,"Wow, that's all I can say!  This is really a ""smart"" TV!  Must admit it's my 1st smart TV, so some things are just fun because they are new to me.  When the TV is off, intead of having a black screen, you can choose to display art (see pics I provided).  There are also fun screen-saver type moving visuals.  Or you can display the weather and/or time, or other things.  Instead of having the TV always listening to you, you can turn that off and just use the listen button on the remote when you want to give commands.  The voice commands are super easy and the TV always understands what I say.  All I have to say is ""music"" and it comes up.  It was so easy to sign into all of my accounts (one-time setup) including Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Spectrum and it's so easy to switch back and forth between them."
62,0001-01-01,3,,Reviewed in the United States ,How To Make This A Beautiful TV,"Samsung has always made beautiful, bright, crisp, colorful TVs. But more and more each year, they ruin it with all kinds of ""Smart"" features. I very nearly returned this TV for being the most frustrating yet. It gave me the most messed-up, ugly, washed-out, dark, unclear picture I've ever seen, and I spent a week trying to get it to look good. Here's how you can make this into a great TV:"
63,0001-01-01,5,,Reviewed in the United States ,Great Picture Quality,I upgraded from a non-HDR 4k TV to this TV and I am amazed at the picture quality. Colors are so much brighter and more vibrant. I also love how the LEDs work. When watching movies and a scene is pitch black the TV goes pitch black and looks like it is off. My old TV would always have a glow in part of the screen and would never be fully black. It wasn't a cheap TV either. It was a high-end Samsung. I'm impressed how far TV technology has come since I bought my old TV around 6-7 years ago.
64,0001-01-01,5,,Reviewed in the United States ,A really good Tv,"I've been using this TV for over 2 years as a computer monitor, and it's been nothing but great. I had a couple of minor issues that were more about my lack of knowledge, but I do wish there were better instructions for using this as a PC monitor (If you want the 4k/120 you need to plug into the top HDMI, it's the only port that is can do 4k/120)."
65,2020-08-19,5,,Reviewed in the United States ,Love Love Love this TV,"I bought this 85in. model because I never wanted to say ""I wish I had gotten the bigger one."".  It is giant and you would expect the image to show every imperfection when the size of peoples heads are 3x to 4x larger than real life."
66,2021-03-29,3,,Reviewed in the United States ,One of the best tvs for the price depending on your usage* (8 month update),"Initial impressions: have not used it for my main intended purpose yet but after two days i can say i have no regrets given my budget restraints. Picture quality is amazing but only after i tuned it to my liking. The intelligent features caused over saturation and bright/light parts if scenes to be blown out. It is too bad because the contrast enhancer on high makes everything look so much better except the blown out issue so i set it to low and adjusted the brightness and contrast levels until it looked its best. Disabled all smart motion features as well as it just added unnatural motion to the image. What im left with is picture quality that is hard to look away from and i love it. The sound quality it pretty good and i dont feel like i need to help it with a sound bar. The tizen os is ok and the ads people complain about havent interrupted my experience so im fine with that but it is certainly not my favorite os and is not nearly as fast and smooth as it should be. One thing some complained about is the anti glare layer which i find to be quite helpful in my particular situation. Yes it does take and isolated glare from a light bulb and spread it across the screen but in doing so it increases visibility through that glare. In most cases i forget the glare Is even there as opposed to my old tv where an isolated glare spot from the light bulb would completely block whatever part of the screen it was on. For those that dont know better, there is only ONE protective layer on the tv. DO NOT try to peel off the anti glare layer."
67,2020-11-26,4,,Reviewed in the United States ,Dollar cost per value is really good. Strong Recommendation,"Video quality is very good. The smart features work well around 95% of the time. The sound quality is surprisingly good though. I thought I'd need a sound bar but im happy with the TV speakers. . I tried my Xbox series x on it. It looks fantastic but there is a caveat.  Although the games I have are made for 4k, the games were not made with 120hz in mind. I can say that the 60hz games look great on it, but I can't compare the 120hz until more games are available. Ill only be able to really test the video quality of games after developers make games specifically for the series x hardware, which takes advantage of high fidelity and high refresh rates."
68,2021-07-24,5,,Reviewed in the United States ,Great Picture and Smart features,"I have read more reviews from more websites than I care to remember.  I purchased the QN85Q80T 85 inch.  I compared the QN85Q80T to the QN85Q80A.  I compared the QN85Q80T to the QN85Q85 Neo QLED and so on.  I ended up selecting the Q80T mainly based on the comparisons shown at RTINGS.com.  Based on my initial experience, I believe I made the right choice"
69,0001-01-01,4,,Reviewed in the United States ,Great picture...OS is clunky,I LOVE this tv. It is the 75inch. Has 4k. Native 120hz refresh rate.
70,0001-01-01,5,,Reviewed in the United States ,This thing is great,"Wife loves Vizio but after our 55"" Vizio crapped out on us after barely a year, I convinced her to let me get one of my beloved Samsung TV's.  I have always had a good experience with Samsung TV's, and this QLED is no exception."
