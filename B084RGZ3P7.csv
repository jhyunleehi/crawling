Intermittently (occurred 2x in past month) it has a small group of pixels that are stuck on white near lower portion of screen.  When I turn off the set over night, it doesn't come back the next day.  Also , every time we use it, sometime during our viewing (we normally watch for 2-3hr 1x/day) the audio drops for 5 s.  I believe it is the TV but it could be the sound system.  It is odd.  It just occurs once each time it happens and at different times after turn on."

3,2020-12-16,4,,Reviewed in the United States ,"Really Good TV, but Not Great","I'm a big fan of Samsung TVs, cell phones and other products.  I currently own 5 Samsung TVs.  Bought the 65"" Q80T to upgrade my 60"" UN60ES7500F bought in 2012 in my family room.  The ES7500F still works great so I moved it to my bedroom.  The Q80T is a beautiful TV, similar in most respects to the ES7500F from 8 years ago.  I upgraded the HDMI cables to 8K cables, and upgraded my Xfinity box to 4K.  The picture is very nice, I would say marginally better than the 7500F.  I expected a more significant improvement.  I even watched several 4K movies and the picture quality was very good. For 4K movies, the black bars appear at the top and bottom of the screen even though I have the options set to full screen on the TV and cable box, very annoying and pretty much defeats having a 4K TV.  In my opinion, I don't want a 65"" TV that is reduced considerably in size by the black bars.  This is not unique to Samsung, but with the option selected it should fill the entire TV screen.  So far, I do not see a big improvement with 4K.  Its really nice, but not so much better than my previous 1080 LED TV."
4,2021-02-26,5,,Reviewed in the United States ,As good as my previous Samsung Smart TV,"I bought this to replace my previous Samsung 46 inch TV, which I bought in 2009(?). This 50inch was the same dimensional size, but without the plastic borders, so the screen is technically larger within the same size."
5,2020-07-28,5,,Reviewed in the United States ,Met expectations and more...,"The last TV I bought was a very good TV and I had yet to see anything that made me want a new TV.  It was also a samsung but was a 2015 model.  I received a great many compliments on that TV from guests who visited us.  As a result, i was very skeptical when I started exploring other TV options.  (the old TV still works fine but we are expanding so why not a new TV right??  lol)"

I have owned it for a week, and have used the Disney + app, Youtube app, Samsung tv plus, and have connected my Wii U, Nintendo Switch, PS3, & regular PS4 to it. I watched a Mission Impossible blu ray on the PS4. Here are my thoughts:"

Perhaps this is due to the limiting factor of picture quality, that is, the source.  My main sources are over-the-air reception and the internet via a dedicated computer.  OTA is allegedly digital, though most of the time it does not look like it; and much of the internet is suppose to be high res, though increasing one's feed to the maximum resolution affects downloads, so I usually go 720 ppi max."
8,2020-08-21,4,,Reviewed in the United States ,Love it,"Arrived a day ahead of expected time, packed securely, box and TV in perfect condition. This is our 2nd QLED, and our 6th Samsung, at home in various rooms, and we have 2 in business office. Very happy with all of them. I do like the smart button OneRemote that Samsung uses. Less is more, as far as buttons are concerned. I HATE remotes with more than about 10 buttons. My preferences for remotes follows the early Apple TV silver remote, before they went to the current glass and touch pad. Samsung has it right on the OneRemote. I will note that as you drop down the Samsung model family, the software on them isn't as robust to recognize other devices, but the Q80T is just fine."
