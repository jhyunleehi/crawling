1,2023-05-29,5,,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 ,SUPER strong and adheres well,"These are the BEST adhesive hooks that I have come across!! I don't think I'll ever go back to the standard white ones since I've never had good luck with those. These are super strong and adhere very very strongly. Make sure that you choose a perfect spot before adhering them because once you stick them, it's hard to get them off to move them to another spot. We have them outside, stuck on our vinyl wall holding our solar cone lights. We didn't want to put holes in our fence so we tried these. They look awesome and you can't even see the hooks, which is what we were going for."
2,2023-02-26,5,,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 ,Strongest hold available! Read below for easy removal,"You won't find a stronger hold than these! I've purchased them multiple times. They hold more weight than you think - which is already a lot. I've only used them in the bathrooms (tile and glass) so I can't speak to using them on a painted wall. As far as durability, you will sleep peacefully with these hooks knowing your shelves (loaded with big shampoos) aren't going to fall down."
3,2023-01-11,5,,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 ,They definitely hold on rough surfaces,"The good news...these STICK on on even rough surfaces!! im decorating a friends wedding in a couple weeks & the venue is VERY strict on basically not using ANYTHING that will leave ANY kind of mark. i made a fake shell light to hang above the table the marriage license will be. its a old clock frame that was maybe thin MDF, the shells are wax paper with thin metal connector loops, and the lights are 2 battery powered led strips so its pretty light weight."
4,2023-05-21,4,,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 ,Really quite strong…,"These are really quite strong! Although, I’m only using them to hang a macrame curtain to divide a room in my new studio apartment. They are clear and the hook small so they stay out of site, which I prefer. The adhesive is super strong on the clear backing, so once it’s on… it’s staying there. I highly recommend these for anything you may want to hang (within a reasonable weight limit) from your ceiling or walls. The price was great for the quantity and quality of the adhesive hooks. Definitely give these a try if you’re on the fence. Great find!"
5,2023-05-13,4,,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 ,So far so good,"I haven't tested the full weight of 13 pounds, but I've used the interior walls and some semi-uneven surfaces, and they have been holding on to where I put them, and the objects I hang like no bodies business."
6,2023-05-28,5,,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 ,I love them,"I used them to hang my faux plants in the ceiling. No mess, no drilling, no permanent damage. My ceiling is not smooth and is a little rough and the hooks stayed on despite that."
7,0001-01-01,5,,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 ,Need to hang plants? No problem,"Hung a very large trailing pothos in a 8"" pot and macrame hanger with one of these. Yes I applied it to painted drywall. Removing it will probably remove the paint. Do I care? No."
8,2023-05-29,4,,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 ,Good buy!,I wasn't disappointed. I used them to hang outdoor string lighting. They worked great and are strong.
9,0001-01-01,5,,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 ,Plant friendly!,"I wanted to hang a plant in my room, and was originally thinking of drilling into the ceiling. I currently rent and figured an adhesive would be easier. Looking at the reviews, I saw some where the plants held up and some that did not. I went ahead and purchased to try it myself. My plant holds up, to the surprise of my roommate and it looks awesome! Totally recommend."
10,2023-04-30,5,,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 ,Super useful!!!,"I got these hooks to replace an item (teddy bear holder) that needed to be hooked over a door. I hated to return the item and really needed it, so I found these on Amazon to use on the wall instead. Which I am wayyyy happier with. I’m going to use this for everything that needs to be hung, versus nails and flimsy tape. This item is sooo strong and durable. Buying more after I post this review!!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
